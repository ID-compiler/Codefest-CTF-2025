## Description
I love mirrors! Its amazing how they do the exactly same thing as you do. I tried to implement a mirror in C! Can’t give you the code tho — it has secrets :)

## Writeup
Giving the Python command that will print the hexadecimal representation of a number, repeating the pattern 100 times.

```bash
$ python3 -c 'print("%x " * 100)'
```
And decoding hex, we get 

*Codefest{FTC_mro05_t4n1r73l_gB_k4AZg1}*

but this is incorrect.

So, Reversing four letters one-by-one

## Flag
`CodefestCTF{f0rm4t_57r1ng_l34k_B1gZA8jW}`
